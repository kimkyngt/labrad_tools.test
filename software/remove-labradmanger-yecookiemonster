As of 8/11/17, we are moving the labrad manager from yecookiemonster(ubuntu) to yeelmo (debian)

Here's what I did:

First, stop the node and manager on yecookiemonster:

sudo systemctl stop labrad-node
sudo systemctl stop labrad-web
sudo systemctl stop labrad-manager

Disable start at bootup (leave labrad-node enabled):

sudo systemctl disable labrad-web
sudo systemctl disable labrad-manger

Reconfigure labrad-node on yecookiemonster to use yeelmo's IP on the Sesame Street network (192.168.1.8) for the labradhost:

sudo gedit /etc/systemd/system/labrad-node.service.d

Change line 2 to:
Environment="LABRADHOST=192.168.1.8"

Restart the labrad node:
sudo systemctl start labrad-node
