Opal Kelly has some software available for download on their [website](https://pins.opalkelly.com/downloads).  

You will need to create an account with them to access their downloads page.  They'll ask for information about a previous order before they approve you for download priviliges.  Ross placed an order a couple of years ago with confirmation #007584.

Download the FrontPanel software for Ubuntu 16.04.  Untar the archive and run the install.sh.  Next, follow the instructions in the README file.  Finally, try running the FrontPanel program.

When trying to run the Front Panel program, it kept complaining about not having a few libboost libraries which are included in Ubuntu 16.04 but not Ubuntu 18.04.  I found them here:  [Boost 1.58 libraries](http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/b/boost1.58/)
