LabRad regularly encounters issues where it will quit working/plotting/etc. A useful tool for diagnosing these issues is looking at the journal.

To run the journal on YeElmo, go to /home/srgang/labrad_tools/systemd and run './labrad-node-journal'.

Similarly, the plotter may go down. Go to YeCountVonCount, /home/srgang/labrad_tools/systemd and run './labrad-node-journal'.
